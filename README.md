A few custom Tampermonkey scripts

**APKMirrorDownloadLink**
This script will open up an alert on APK Mirror download pages. If you say ok, it will push the download link to your Pushbullet device of choice so it can be quickly downloaded. No more downloading then pushing the file to your device, or loading the page on your phone and then downloading. Handy if you click a Twitter or Google+ link on your computer but want to send the file to your phone or tablet. Make sure to put your Pushbullet access token (Settings > Account) and device id/friend email/channel tag (can easily be found by selecting a device, friend, or channel in the web interface and looking in the url) in the appropriate variables.

**ColoradoanCookieClearer**
Clears cookies on the coloradoan.com website so that you can view unlimited articles a month.  Could be adapted for any website of your choosing.

**TfsSliderHeight**
In TFS 2013 by default the query results take up half the screen and work item details take up the other half. This script moves the slider so that work item details take up more space if a query has less than 14 results. Make sure to adjust for your TFS server url.
